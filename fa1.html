	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p>What do you think the start of your workday look like? What do you wear, where do you go, and what’s the environment like? You can add pictures here. Make sure to cite your sources.</p>
	      <p>The start of a doctor's workday is a structured, early ritual centered on preparation and patient focus. Arriving well before the first appointment, I dedicate time to reviewing electronic charts, lab results, and imaging studies to synthesize a comprehensive plan for each patient. My attire, typically scrubs or professional clothes under a white lab coat, promotes hygiene and signals my role, while essential tools like a stethoscope are always at hand. The environment is a clean, well-lit clinic characterized by a low hum of activity and focused energy among the staff. We conduct brief, crucial morning huddles to coordinate the day's flow and address any urgent, complex cases. Patient confidentiality is paramount, so clinical discussions remain private and secured. This period of intellectual and logistical alignment ensures efficiency and allows me to transition smoothly into the day's core task. Ultimately, the dawn of the clinic prepares me to offer informed, seamless, and compassionate care.</p>

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p>Describe your main job duties or activities. Who do you work with? What tools or skills do you use?</p>
	      <p>My main job duties as a physician revolve around four pillars: patient care, communication, administration, and learning. The most central activity is, of course, the direct care of patients, which involves thorough history-taking, physical examinations, interpreting diagnostic tests (like lab work and imaging), and formulating evidence-based treatment plans. I spend a significant portion of my time performing procedures, prescribing and managing medications, and offering preventative counseling on diet, exercise, and screening.
			I do not work alone; medicine is a team sport. I collaborate constantly with a diverse medical team, including nurses and medical assistants for direct patient care, specialists for referrals and complex conditions, pharmacists for medication management, and social workers/case managers to ensure patients have necessary support resources.
			The tools I rely on go beyond the physical. While I use a stethoscope, otoscope, and medical instruments, my most crucial tools are critical thinking (to diagnose complex issues), communication skills (to explain diagnoses clearly and elicit patient trust), and the Electronic Health Record (EHR) for documentation and data access. The essential skills are compassion, active listening, and problem-solving.</p>

	      <p>Here, you will see that doctors are some of the most important people in our lives. They are the experts we turn to when we are hurt, sick, or worried about our health. They promise to help us with any problem, big or small, and they often greet us with a warm, friendly face. However, this helpful exterior hides a truth: the life of a doctor is incredibly difficult, demanding a high level of sacrifice and commitment every single day. The main reason a doctor's life is hard is the immense pressure they face. Before they even start their career, they must spend many years studying difficult science and complex procedures. Even after graduation, their education never truly ends, as they must constantly learn about new diseases and treatments. Their work schedules are demanding, often requiring them to work long, exhausting shifts that include late nights and weekends. They frequently miss important family events because they are needed in the hospital. The largest burden they carry is the emotional weight of making life-or-death decisions. When a patient is seriously ill, the doctor is responsible for that person's well-being, which creates a level of stress few other jobs can match.
			Despite this demanding life, doctors are there to help us with any problem, from a simple cold to a major emergency. They are experts in the human body, and they use their deep knowledge to find solutions and heal us. Their job is not just about fixing bones or giving medicine; it is also about listening to our fears and offering comfort. This is where their friendly nature is so important. When we are scared or in pain, a kind smile and a calm explanation from a doctor can make us feel safe and understood. They are trained to show compassion and patience, creating a welcoming atmosphere where we feel comfortable sharing our personal health issues, knowing we will receive non-judgmental and effective help. </p>

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p>There was this young man who had a disability. His name was Austin. He had a medical condition called "Autism", where it is a condition related to brain development that affects how people see others and socialize with them. This causes problems in communication and getting along with others socially. The condition also includes limited and repeated patterns of behavior. I met him once in Medical School where he was being teased on by his other classmates. I helped him from them and decided to have a conversation with him. He is a gifted kid with a broad and wide knowledge about medicine and the human body. I saw great potential in him just like my parents and friends saw in me. Now, Austin is a resident in my hospital at Davao Doctors Hospital and I continue to guide and assist him every part of his journey.</p>
